    "message": "Hello! It sounds like you're looking for a tool to help with UI/UX design for your app. There are several great options available, each with its own strengths.\n\n1. **Sketch**: This is a popular choice among designers for creating interfaces. It has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to use. However, it's only available for macOS.\n\n2. **Figma**: Figma is a web-based tool that supports real-time collaboration and has a growing popularity. It offers a free tier and is compatible with various operating systems.\n\n3. **Adobe XD**: Adobe XD is a user-friendly tool from Adobe, offering a wide range of features, including prototyping and collaboration. It integrates well with other Adobe products.\n\n4. **InVision**: InVision is another powerful tool that focuses on prototyping and collaboration. It allows you to create interactive prototypes and even conduct user testing.\n\n5. **Affinity Designer**: If you're already using Affinity Photo or Affinity Photo, you might find Affinity Designer a good fit. It's a vector graphics editor that also supports UI/UX design.\n\nEach of these tools has its own learning curve, so it's worth trying out a few to see which one feels most comfortable for you. I'd recommend starting with free trials if possible. Good luck with your app design!"
